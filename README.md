## Workflow
### Step 1: Configure the Environment
Before running the workflow, ensure you have **Anaconda** installed on your system.

1. Create a new Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n peptide_MDI

2. Activate the environment：
   ```bash
   conda activate peptide_MDI
   
3. Install Nextflow：
   ```bash
   conda install -c bioconda nextflow

### Step 2: Navigate to the Working Directory
Switch to the directory containing the workflow scripts and resources:
```bash
   cd /path/to/peptide_MDI

### Step 3: Upload the required files into the in_put folder:
